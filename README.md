# txt2img

Basic Python library to make an image out of plane text (good for app submition).

## What?

I started looking into what it takes to get an app published to the Playstore/Appstore. It looks fine, except you have to upload images. My app(s) will be targeted at the blind audience, so screen shots weren't really necessary, as I would have no way to know if it captured the app or not, and they wouldn't look at them really anyways. And instead of putting like a picture of my thumb/the floor, I decided to look how to do it with Python. And here we are!
